Detailed evaluation criteria for each dimension.

---

## Dimension 1: Content & Ideas (10 points)

|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Original, nuanced thesis that challenges conventional thinking. Argument handles complexity and contradiction without oversimplification. |
| 7-8 | Clear, defensible thesis with some depth. Argument shows awareness of nuance. |
| 5-6 | Thesis present but generic or predictable. Argument is functional but lacks depth. |
| 3-4 | Thesis unclear or too broad. Argument is superficial or contains logical gaps. |
| 1-2 | No discernible thesis. Argument is incoherent or absent. |

### Evidence & Analysis

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Evidence is precisely chosen and deeply analyzed. Analysis reveals meaning beyond the obvious—explains WHY and HOW, not just WHAT. |
| 7-8 | Evidence is relevant and adequately analyzed. Shows understanding of significance. |
| 5-6 | Evidence present but analysis is surface-level. Tends to summarize rather than analyze. |
| 3-4 | Evidence is weak, irrelevant, or missing. Analysis is absent or incorrect. |
| 1-2 | No meaningful evidence. No analysis attempted. |

### Critical Thinking

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Demonstrates sophisticated reasoning. Questions assumptions, considers multiple perspectives, acknowledges limitations. |
| 7-8 | Shows clear reasoning. Addresses counterarguments adequately. |
| 5-6 | Basic reasoning present. May ignore obvious counterarguments. |
| 3-4 | Reasoning is flawed or absent. Falls into logical fallacies. |
| 1-2 | No evidence of critical thinking. |

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Binary thinking (all good/all bad)

## Dimension 2: Organization & Structure (10 points)

### Overall Architecture

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Structure enhances the argument. Each paragraph serves a clear purpose in building the case. Reader never feels lost. |
| 7-8 | Clear, logical structure. Introduction, body, conclusion work together effectively. |
| 5-6 | Basic structure present but may feel mechanical (five-paragraph formula). Some sections feel disconnected. |
| 3-4 | Structure is confusing or illogical. Paragraphs don't clearly connect to thesis. |
| 1-2 | No discernible structure. Stream of consciousness. |

### Paragraph Development

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Each paragraph has a clear claim, develops it fully with evidence and analysis, and connects to the broader argument. |
| 7-8 | Paragraphs generally unified with clear topic sentences. Development is adequate. |
| 5-6 | Some paragraphs lack focus or try to cover too much. Topic sentences may be weak. |
| 3-4 | Paragraphs are unfocused or underdeveloped. Ideas scattered across multiple paragraphs. |
| 1-2 | No paragraph structure or logic. |

### Transitions & Flow

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Transitions are organic—ideas flow naturally from one to the next through logical connection, not mechanical connectors. |
| 7-8 | Transitions are clear and mostly effective. Logical progression is evident. |
| 5-6 | Relies on mechanical transitions ("Furthermore," "In addition"). Connections between ideas are adequate but could be smoother. |
| 3-4 | Transitions are abrupt, missing, or illogical. Reader must work to follow the argument. |
| 1-2 | No transitions. Ideas feel random. |

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Overuse of "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover"
- Topic sentences that don't connect to thesis
- Conclusions that merely repeat introduction
- Paragraphs that end without connecting to the next idea

| 5-6 | Some variety but tends toward repetitive patterns. Sentences are functional but not sophisticated. |
| 3-4 | Little variety. Many short, choppy sentences OR long, run-on sentences. |
| 1-2 | No sentence variety. Syntax impedes comprehension. |

### Word Choice (Diction)
