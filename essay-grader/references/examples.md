## Example 1: A-Level Essay (Score: 46/50)

### Excerpt (Literary Analysis - The Great Gatsby)

> Fitzgerald's use of the green light has been exhaustively analyzed as a symbol of Gatsby's hope, but this reading obscures something more troubling: the light is not merely a symbol of desire but of desire's fundamental impossibility. Gatsby does not want Daisy—he wants to want Daisy, to perpetually exist in the state of yearning. This distinction matters because it reframes Gatsby not as a tragic romantic but as someone addicted to longing itself.
>
> Consider how Gatsby behaves once he actually reunites with Daisy. Nick observes that "there must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion." The grammar here is revealing: Fitzgerald writes "tumbled short" rather than "fell short," suggesting something active in the disappointment, as if reality itself stumbles against the architecture of fantasy. Gatsby's dream requires Daisy's absence to survive; her presence can only diminish it.

## Example 2: B-Level Essay (Score: 41/50)

### Excerpt (Argumentative Essay - Social Media)

> Social media has fundamentally changed how teenagers form their identities. While some argue this is entirely negative, the reality is more complex. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok offer both opportunities for self-expression and risks of comparison and anxiety.
>
> Research from the Pew Research Center shows that 72% of teenagers use social media daily. This constant connectivity means that identity formation, which once happened primarily through face-to-face interactions, now occurs in a public, documented space. A teenager's "brand"—their curated online persona—becomes a project requiring constant maintenance. As psychologist Jean Twenge notes in her research, this shift correlates with increased rates of anxiety among Gen Z.
>
> However, social media also provides spaces for marginalized youth to find community. LGBTQ+ teenagers in conservative areas can connect with others who share their experiences. This positive aspect shouldn't be dismissed in the rush to condemn social media entirely.

### Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Gap to 10 |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content & Ideas | 8/10 | Analysis of "identity as brand" remains surface-level; implications unexplored |
| Organization | 8/10 | Transitions functional but mechanical; lacks sophisticated flow |
| Language & Style | 8/10 | Competent but generic; no distinctive voice or memorable phrasing |
| Conventions | 9/10 | Citation format slightly inconsistent |
| Advanced Skills | 8/10 | Acknowledges complexity but doesn't push into original territory |

**Scoring Rationale:**
- Clear thesis acknowledging complexity
- Uses research evidence effectively
- Logical structure with counterargument
- Competent academic prose throughout

## Example 3: C-Level Essay (Score: 36/50)

### Excerpt (Literary Analysis - Romeo and Juliet)

> In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare shows that love can be both beautiful and destructive. Romeo and Juliet fall in love at first sight, but their love leads to their deaths. This shows that love is complicated.
>
> One example of destructive love is when Romeo kills Tybalt. He does this because Tybalt killed his friend Mercutio. Romeo says "fire-eyed fury be my conduct now" (3.1.129). This quote shows that Romeo is angry and not thinking clearly. His love for Juliet has made him emotional, which leads to bad decisions.
>
> Another example is when Juliet takes the sleeping potion. She does this because she loves Romeo and doesn't want to marry Paris. This is risky because a lot could go wrong, which it does. This shows that love makes people do dangerous things.

### Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Gap to 10 |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content & Ideas | 6/10 | Thesis generic ("love is complicated"); analysis describes WHAT happens not WHY it matters; quote present but not deeply analyzed |
| Organization | 7/10 | Mechanical template structure; transitions formulaic ("One example," "Another example") |
| Language & Style | 7/10 | No distinctive voice; repetitive sentence structure; generic word choices |
| Conventions | 8/10 | Citation attempted but analysis of quote superficial |
| Advanced Skills | 8/10 | No original insight; safe interpretation; no engagement with textual complexity |

**Scoring Rationale:**
- Basic five-paragraph structure functions
- Evidence exists but analysis stays at "quote and explain"
- Meets minimum requirements without distinction
- Reads like assignment completion

## Example 4: D-Level Essay (Score: 32/50)

### Excerpt (Argumentative Essay - School Start Times)

> Schools should start later because students are tired. When I have to wake up at 6am I can't focus in class. A lot of my friends feel the same way. Starting school later would help students do better.
>
> Studies show that teenagers need more sleep. Their brains are still developing and sleep is important for brain development. When students don't get enough sleep they can't learn as well. This is why schools should start later.
>
> Some people say that if school starts later it will end later and interfere with sports and jobs. But I think sleep is more important than sports. Students can adjust their schedules. The benefits of more sleep outweigh the problems.

### Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Gap to 10 |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content & Ideas | 5/10 | "Studies show" without citation; personal anecdote replaces evidence; counterargument dismissed not engaged |
| Organization | 6/10 | Paragraphs underdeveloped; points raised but not developed with depth |
| Language & Style | 6/10 | Informal register ("A lot of my friends"); repetitive simple sentences; no variety |
| Conventions | 7/10 | No citations despite claiming research; generally readable |
| Advanced Skills | 8/10 | Oversimplifies issue; "I think" signals opinion not argument; no complexity |

**Scoring Rationale:**
- Thesis clear but argument shallow
- Claims without supporting evidence
- Too informal for academic context
- Structure present but no depth

## Example 5: F-Level Essay (Score: 22/50)

### Excerpt (Analysis Essay)

> Macbeth is about ambition. Macbeth wants to be king so he kills Duncan. Lady Macbeth helps him. They both go crazy in the end. Shakespeare is saying that ambition is bad.
>
> The witches are important because they tell Macbeth he will be king. This makes him want to be king. If the witches didn't tell him maybe he wouldn't of killed Duncan. The witches represent fate or evil I'm not sure which.
>
> In conclusion Macbeth shows that too much ambition leads to bad things happening. We should learn from Macbeth and not be too ambitious. This is why the play is still relevant today.

### Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Gap to 10 |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content & Ideas | 3/10 | Summary not analysis; no thesis beyond "ambition is bad"; admits uncertainty rather than analyzing |
| Organization | 4/10 | Paragraph structure present but no development; conclusion adds nothing new |
| Language & Style | 4/10 | Basic vocabulary; no sentence variety; "I'm not sure which" inappropriate for formal essay |
| Conventions | 5/10 | Grammar errors ("wouldn't of"); no quotes or textual citations |
| Advanced Skills | 6/10 | No analytical thinking evident; moral lesson oversimplifies; plot summary dominates |

**Scoring Rationale:**
- Retells plot rather than analyzes
- No textual evidence from the play
- Doesn't attempt analytical argument
- Grammar errors impede comprehension
- Shows no understanding of literary analysis requirements

## Calibration Notes

When scoring, use these examples as anchor points:

| Grade | Total Score | Key Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| A | 45-50 | Original insight, distinctive voice, intellectual risk-taking |
| B | 40-44 | Solid thesis, good evidence, competent but lacks spark |
| C | 33-39 | Meets requirements, generic analysis, mechanical structure |
| D | 25-32 | Shallow argument, missing evidence, significant gaps |
| F | Below 25 | Summary not analysis, fundamental misunderstanding |

**Remember:** Each "Gap to 10" should identify what's missing compared to a perfect score in that dimension, NOT provide instructions on how to fix it.
